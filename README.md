# Build your Dream
Build your dream is a imaginary blog where users can share their own pc builds, find inspiration from other builds and interact with other pc-builders. Here everyone can see what is out there before, during and after building your own computer. 

It is meant to be a place for people to exchange information and just show off their work. Hence the target audience are pc enthusiats who want to present their own build with helpful imformation for future pc builders and for those future pc-builders to get inspired by others work.
The post will have professional tags by the build-your-dream-team so that users can search through the contents by parts and characteristics they are looking for. Moreover users can express their feelings about a post via comments and a like function.

Moreover as this imaginary website is still new and wants to adapt to the users' needs, users can give recommendation of what changes and possible features they would implement on the blog. Therefore, Build Your Dream tries to build a growing community of builders that want to exchange information with one another in a respectful way.

### Accessibility
#### Lighthouse Testing
The main problem with my Best Practice score is that cloudinary uses http:// insteast of https:/ when transfering images.
Moreover as the user can upload images whichever format and they are made to fit the cards, the performance suffers through this, especially in mobile view as a third-party cloud-based platform can create succh problems.

#### Wave Testing
As Wave did not let me sign-in to test pages that only appear as a logged in user, only the pages that are shown without being logged in were tested.
There are some contrast-errors, but as neither lighthouse nor personal testers with minor vision disabilities had problems with them I decided to keep the contrast as it is.

<details>
<summary>quiz.js</summary>
No errors. Warnings about semantics that could be confusing, however, as these variables concern variables from another JS-file they do exist due to their size they are just stored in the questions.js

### Form Testing

### Links Testing
- All internal links are working and redirecting the user to the pages they are meant to redirect them to. 
- All external links are working and redirecting, through a separate tab, the user to the external website they are meant to be redirected to.


### Browser Testing
The website was successfully tested on the following browsers:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

### Device Testing
- This website was viewed and tested on various devices such as smartphones (Iphone X, Samsung Galaxy S20, Iphone 13, Huawei P40 Pro+), laptops and desktops to guarantee that it is responsive for several screen sizes. Full successful testing was performed on all of the devices.


- The following websites, besides google dev tools, were used to check responsiveness:
    - [Am I Responsive - Index Page](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://xakkusu.github.io/)
    - [Am I Responsive -  Page](x)
    - [Am I Responsive - 404 Page](hx)
