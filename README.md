# Build your Dream
Build your dream is a imaginary blog where users can share their own pc builds, find inspiration from other builds and interact with other pc-builders. Here everyone can see what is out there before, during and after building your own computer. 

It is meant to be a place for people to exchange information and just show off their work. Hence the target audience are pc enthusiats who want to present their own build with helpful imformation for future pc builders and for those future pc-builders to get inspired by others work.
The post will have professional tags by the build-your-dream-team so that users can search through the contents by parts and characteristics they are looking for. Moreover users can express their feelings about a post via comments and a like function.

Moreover as this imaginary website is still new and wants to adapt to the users' needs, users can give recommendation of what changes and possible features they would implement on the blog. Therefore, Build Your Dream tries to build a growing community of builders that want to exchange information with one another in a respectful way.

## AGILE
The agile metholody way applied for this project. The To-Do's were split according to their uer stories into sprints. To graphically represent this and not just have each sprint with its goals, tests etc on paper Github's project board was used to show this each springt and tasks as well. As I also use the agile system in my professional life (project management) I didn't always update the digital board and move user stories as I did it in my notes, hence you can see in the documentation of the board that a lot of stories were done at once. However, through my commits one can see that after each small step that worked, and through a lot of testing and fixing the code in between, one can see how this framework was well implemented into each step/sprint of the project.

>[Project Board](https://github.com/users/Xakkusu/projects/5)

My mentor adviced me to only keep sprints that are within the scope of my project. So I also implemented a section called "for next run" where future sprints are in that are possible future features but are not needed in the current project.


##  ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM - ERD
The following diagram illustrates the models used in this project and their relationships to one another:

<img src="documentation/pp4-erd.png" alt="ERD" >

The user model is created by [Django AllAuth](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/) library for user authentication, hence it was not written by me but solely installed and used. The taggit_tag was created by the [django-taggit](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) application and used for its well developed tagging system.


## FINAL DESIGN
### Imagery
It was chosen to include no images besides the build post images into this project. This was done after intense research into similar websites as well as question being asked to people that enjoy similar content. As the user can upload an image themselves the superuser can still decide through their approval process if this image is fitting or if it will not be shown.
The only image used is the one of the default build post and the hero image. Both where chosen in-synch with the projects colour scheme, of which you can find out more [here](#color-scheme). The default images fits the card sizing more as we figured that most people would upload an image of their build to show it off. However, it is still a pleasing image. The hero image was brightened a lot to make it stand out and makle it easier to read the text on it. Both are of greyish pc builds, which is commom for this kind of content. The rathe dry styling fits the theme as well.


### Color Scheme

<img src="documentation/color-scheme.png" alt="Color scheme" >

In tone with most pc build related content A greyish color range was chosen. As most pc build themselves are mostly still black and grey it was seen as fitting for this project. Depending on the content the colors vary. The only exception are edit and delete buttons, with a more yellor and a distinct red color. The colors also do not take away from the content and perfectly keep the users focus on the build post, especially on the uploaded images. It was important to not make the website too dark and hence make it unpleasend to spend more time on the posts. The main color of the font is either complete white as in the bootstrap settings for a lot of the color related keywords or a #fafafa was chosen as it is a tat more pleasing for the eye, but in some cases it does not make the text stand out as much at it needs to be. Hence, especially when bootstrap was used in styling content the #fff (white) color is used. Yet this color still is in line with the color scheme.
The color palette was created by using the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography
- As bootstrap styling devices were used througout this website, the main fallback font where a native font stack is used which selects the best font-family for each OS and device, more on this [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/).
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the following fonts:
- ![Lato font image](documentation/font-lato.png) 
[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=Lato)
was chosen for all content where the user can either directly see the content of a post and give feedback to it (show build post and future content requests) and the navbar items to make them stand out to the user and indicate that this is their main content to interact with. The font was chosen as it is simple yet it fits the content and pc builds, therefore it stays in line with the website's styling.
- ![Robotoc font image](documentation/font-roboto.png) 
[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=Roboto)
was used for buttons and links that are not directly related to editing content, yet still show the user that they can do something "different" when interacting with it. It is again a simple font that many pc related websites use. 
- Sans Serif was chosen as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## FEATURES

All pages are responsive, if content can be interacted with the cursor will become a pointer . Other things they have the following in common:

#### Navbar

Desktop:

<img src="documentation/features/navbar-desktop.png" width="50%" alt="desktop navbar">

- All pages have a navbar fixed at the top of the page.
- This shows the title which is selectable and redirects the user to the landing page.
- It also show the main menu items which when hovering have a lighter backdrop and the page you are on is also in a lighter color. This is done to indicate to the user that these things can be selected and on which page thei are.
- Depending if you are logged in or logged out logout, login or sign-up sections appear in the navbar.

Mobile:

<img src="documentation/features/navbar-mobile-1.png" width="30%" alt="mobille navbar image 1"> <img src="documentation/features/navbar-mobile-2.png" width="30%" alt="mobille navbar image 2">

- When the user is on a mobile device or another smaller screen size the navbar collapses and shows a hamburger menu.
- The user can hence consume more of the content of the body.
- When the menu icon is clicked the whole menu can be seen and the user can select one.

- If a certain limit of posts (e.g.: 8) is exceeded the user can only see the maximal number of posts on each page. They can select to go to later-, previous-, the first- and the last page.
- This is done to not overwhelm the user with content and with a very long page.

### Show build post
#### Build post contend
![Build post Content](documentation/features/build-content.png)

- After selection a build post the user is redirected to the full post.

## TESTING
### Accessibility
#### Lighthouse Testing
The main problem with my Best Practice score is that cloudinary uses http:// insteast of https:/ when transfering images.
Moreover as the user can upload images whichever format and they are made to fit the cards, the performance suffers through this, especially in mobile view as a third-party cloud-based platform can create succh problems.

#### Wave Testing
As Wave did not let me sign-in to test pages that only appear as a logged in user, only the pages that are shown without being logged in were tested.
There are some contrast-errors, but as neither lighthouse nor personal testers with minor vision disabilities had problems with them I decided to keep the contrast as it is.

### W3C Validators
#### HTML
All testing was done via direct input of the code instead of entering the URL, as I wanted to see immediately if errors were fixed.

There were some errors shown in the W3C Markup Validator which I was able to fix like errors with the alpine.js. Here are all the W3C results with minor warnings and tips, which will be looked at when time resource free themselves:

<details>
<summary>No Errors</summary>
